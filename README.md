<h1 align="center">Shani Kumar</h1>
<p align="center">Welcome to my data science portfolio. <br>
I have created this portfolio to show my recent work on different data science projects.</p>


<h1> About </h1>
<p> I am a Mainframe Application Programmer, and most of my time goes into writing Assembler code. I have 8+ years of experience in Card Payment Processing. <br>
Based on my experience from the past few years, I have realized data is very powerful, and when you have huge data at hand, you can get a lot of information that can help make better-informed decisions. This brought me to data science. Currently, I am perusing Masters in Data Science at Bellevue University and loving my journey in Data Science so far. </p>

<h1> Projects </h1>

[Project 1: Employee Retention Issue](https://github.com/sutharshani/employee_retention): Employee Retention is a critical problem for employers as it impacts their growth and ability to complete. Here, 
I will discuss how we can build a model that can help the HR team in identifying employees that 
can leave the organization so that they can work with employees and take corrective measures to reduce 
the attrition rate problem by working with employees at risk of leaving the organization. In Data Science world to deal 
with this type of issue the term used is “Employee churn analytics” which is the process of evaluating 
employee staff turnover rates to predict the future and reduce employee churn. For this project, 
I am using IBM employee data from Kaggle [2]. I will use this dataset to understand different features within the
dataset and then use the same to build machine learning models using different algorithms to find what algorithm 
works best and what is accuracy.  

[Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sutharshani/DSC-530-Project): In this project I did some exploratory analysis to answer certain questions

[Project 3: Analysis on Air Travel Safety through Data Visualization](https://github.com/sutharshani/Analysis-on-Air-Travel-Safety): Using Air-Travel historical data I will be performing data visualization to 
learn about the data to answer the outstanding question.

[Project 4: Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/sutharshani/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection): The scope of this project is to research and identify different types of predictive analysis algorithms available that can be applied to determine and stop fraudulent transactions.

[Project 5: Twitter Sentimental Analysis](https://github.com/sutharshani/Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis): Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses,
online and social media, and healthcare materials for applications that range from marketing to customer service
to clinical medicine. Using this project I will perform sentimental analysis using Twitter data.
This will help me learn more about NLP.

[Project 6: Image Classification](https://github.com/sutharshani/Image-Classification): Image classification is a technique which we use to identify an object with-in the image.
Using this project I will learn how can we perform Image classification using Keras & TensorFlow.

[Project 7: Web-Scraping through Python](https://github.com/sutharshani/Webscraping-in-Python): Web scraping is the process of collecting and parsing raw data from the Web. It is one of the important way of getting data when there is no way to get data through API or any other means. Using this project I will learn more about Web-Scraping techniques we can use to get data.

[Project 8: Weather Application](https://github.com/sutharshani/Weather-Application): Using this project I will get exposure to understand how can we expose JSON API using Python and get the work done.

[Project 9: Poster on Stock Price Prediction](https://github.com/sutharshani/Poster-on-Stock-Price-Prediction):In this project, we research techniques that we can use to make investment decisions better. Good prediction models will offer a better understanding of stock price movement and associated risks. 
A good decision can impact their returns on equity.

[Project 10: Time Series Modelling](https://github.com/sutharshani/Time-Series-Modelling):Time series analysis uses methods to analyze time series data using statistics and other analytics methods. Time series forecasting is used to predict future values based on historical data.
