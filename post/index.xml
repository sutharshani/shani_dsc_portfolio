      <description>Employee attrition or turnover occurs when an employee leaves the organization. It is different from employee discharge, termination, resignation, and abandonment. In the case of employee attrition, when the employee leaves the company, employee position remains unfilled. But in the case of turnover, the position is filled by a replacement employee.
Here I will discuss how we can build a model that can help HR in identifying employees that can leave the organization so that they can work with employees and take corrective measures to reduce the attrition problem related to employees leaving the organization.</description>
